I am currently doing some professional development by completing a Certificate course at a local Vocational Education and Training college.

At the present time, I am unavailable to be asked to do any additional work, or collaborations.

I enjoy coding, (watching) various sports.

There have been a lot of technological changes since I received my Masters degree in Information Technology, and I am furthering my education by challenging myself to learn about some of this newer technology.  Some of this technology was only coming through as a very early offering, and not a lot of it had been implemented by various organisations in the years of my previous studies at both University, and other Vocational Education and Training organisations.

I am intending to continue my studies in the next year, by enrolling in the advanced course of my current studies.

After I have completed those studies, I will be looking at gaining some employment to further enhance my skill set.  This employment may be on a consulting basis, participating in some of the applications / programs on GitHub, or working for an organisation.  I am open for any or all of these opportunities in the future.

I am happy to hear from people who may be able to help me in any of the pursuits listed above, and / or from people who may like to see what I could help them with at this time.

Thank you for reading this, and if you would like to contact me, you can contact me via my LinkedIn profile at
